Hello! I am a second year Master of Public Health Candidate at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health, studying Environmental Health Sciences with a Certificate in Applied Biostatistics and Public Health Data Science. 

I graduated from Cornell University in 2021 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Environmental Sustainability Sciences and minors in Business, Global Health, Development Sociology, Climate Change, and Health Equity.

I am particularly interested in exploring the interdisciplinary nature of public health. Through my education, work experiences, and research opportunities, I am striving to incorporate data and research to public health through regenerative approaches that may mitigate health hazards and achieve sustainable solutions.

If you have any questions and want to connect, please feel free to email me at ep385@cornell.edu!
